# This YAML file contains crucial calibrations for the robot.                               #
# Any modifications should be carefully reviewed and validated.                             #
# Incorrect settings can lead to unexpected behavior or damage to the equipment.            #

#!Webcam settings
# This section describes the desired image quality.
# When talking about image, we are directly describing the webcam capture.
resolution_x: 1920 # Image heigth
resolution_y: 1080 # Image width
flip_x_axis: false # Flip the image along the X axis
flip_y_axis: true # Flip the image along the Y axis

#!Color settings
# This section describes the bounds for detecting objects by color
# All values must be expressed in the HSL range
# Hue is contained between 0 and 360
hue:
  - 85.0 # Min hue
  - 150.0 # Max hue
# Saturation is contained between 0 and 100
saturation:
  - 10.0 # Min saturation
  - 100.0 # Max saturation
# Lightness is contained between 0 and 100
lightness:
  - 10.0 # Min light
  - 80.0 # Max light

#!Sensitivity settings
# This section describes the sensitivity of the movement algorithm
# By default, the gripping zone is the center of the image
center_offset_x: 0 # How many pixels on the X axis to offset the center by
center_offset_y: 0 # How many pixels on the Y axis to offset the center by
max_deviation: 0.0 # Epressed in pixels, how far can the object be from the center

#!Networking settings
# This section describes the settings for making the POST requests for communication with the hardware
request_ip: "http://192.168.4.1" # The destination of the POST requests
webgui_port: ":8080" # The port on wich to start the webserver

#!Debugging settings
# This section describes the settings used for debugging
# Live reload is a very expensive feature, that provides minimal improvements
# If possible, please disable this
live_reload: true # If this calibrations file should be continuously read, in order to keep calibrations up to date
reload_interval: 500 # In miliseconds, how much time to wait between each reload 

#!Movement settings
# This section describes the way the robot moves
rotation_speed: 75 # An integer contained between 0 and 255, describing the speed of rotation of the baseplate
upwards_speed: 255 # An integer between 0 and 255, describing the speed whilst moving upwards
extension_speed: 255 # An integer between 0 and 255, describing the speed of extension of the second actuator 

#!Limitations settings
# This section describes the hardware limits of each component
rotation_limit: 0 # How many miliseconds can this part run at the specified speed, before it hits a limit
rotation_revolution: 25000 # How many miliseconds does it take to do a full loop and return to the start position
upwards_limit: 25000 # How many miliseconds can this part run at the specified speed, before it hits a limit
extension_limit: 25000 # How many miliseconds can this part run at the specified speed, before it hits a limit

#!Manual mode settings
manual_interval: 2000.0 # How many miliseconds to move
