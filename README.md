## Introduction
We are excited to introduce our cutting-edge robotics system designed specifically for the efficient retrieval of objects based on their color within a designated workspace. This innovative technology harnesses a sophisticated computer vision algorithm to precisely identify and collect objects of the desired color. Once retrieved, these items are systematically stored in a centralized location for further processing or analysis.

## Instalation
To successfully install this software on your local machine, begin by obtaining the source code from the most recent release. Following this, ensure that its dependencies, specifically the Go programming language, are installed on your system. This involves downloading and setting up Go as per the software's requirements.

## Usage
In order to run this project, simply open a terminal and execute the following command:
```bash
go run .
```

## Goals
We are dedicated to creating more advanced and accurate robotics systems to tackle the global challenge of insufficient or inadequate quality control. Our goal is to develop innovative technologies that significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of quality control processes across various industries worldwide. In order to establish pioneering foundations within the realm of robotics, we have worked day and night to build what today we call OVI-MK2. To this day, we still keep our promises to only deliver the best quality and performance to your application.
